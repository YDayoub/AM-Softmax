# AM-Softmax
The repo contains a pytorch implementation for the AM-Softmax loss presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05599.pdf).
Code itself is adapted from [here](https://github.com/Leethony/Additive-Margin-Softmax-Loss-Pytorch/blob/master/AdMSLoss.py).
The modification is adapted from [here](https://github.com/mikwieczorek/centroids-reid/blob/main/losses/center_loss.py).
